# Biography

Dr. Panos Markopoulos a tenure-track Assistant Professor with the department of Electrical and Microelectronic Engineering (EME) at Rochester Insitute of Technology, where he directs the Signal Processing for Data Communication and Analysis (SCAN) Research Group and co-directs the EME Communications Laboratory. His research is in the areas of Signal Processing, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Wireless Communications. He obtained the Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in 2015, from University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, advised by Professor Dimitris A. Pados.

In January 2017, Dr. Markopoulos was distinguished as Exemplary Reviewer of IEEE Wireless Communications Letters (IEEE WCL). Since September 2017, he serves as Editor of IEEE WCL. In August 2013, he received the best paper award at the IEEE International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS 2013).
